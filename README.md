Github Tutorial

Hello! I'm a mechanical engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin that's
also pursuing a computing certificate and looking to switch to data science or software development!

My expertise is machine learning using Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
but I am quickly broadenning my skillset into Java and Django.
